# SD Advisory Group — GitHub Pages

Single‑repo static site built from your three HTML pages.

## Pages
- `/index.html` → main homepage (from `sd_advisory_site_pro_gradient2.html`)
- `/consultation.html` → consultation page (from `New Consultation Page.html`)
- `/business.html` → business page (from `New website 10_11_UPDATED.html`)

## Booking link
All CTAs normalized to **https://cal.com/selfdeficonsultant/15min**.

## Deploy on GitHub Pages (user/organization site)
1) Create a new GitHub repo, e.g. `sd-advisory-site` (Public).
2) Upload these files.
3) Go to **Settings → Pages**.
4) Set **Build and deployment → Source: Deploy from a branch**.
5) Set **Branch: `main` → `/ (root)`**, then **Save**.
6) Your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/sd-advisory-site/`.

## (Optional) Custom domain
- Add a file named `CNAME` containing your domain (e.g., `self-defi.xyz`), then
- Point DNS at your registrar: `A` records to GitHub Pages or `CNAME` to `<username>.github.io` per GitHub docs.

## Local preview
Open `index.html` in a browser. All links are relative and should work locally and on Pages.
